# Online-Shop-Database
A database management code written with python and SQLite3 and the UI created with prettyTable. You can either sign in as a seller and add, delete, or edit products from the database, or a customer and buy products or add a certain product to the database. This was done as a university project, I tried to make it as detailed as possible ^^
